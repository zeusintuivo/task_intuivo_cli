1. Project Structure

    src/
        main.rs: Entry point of the application.
        config/
            mod.rs: Handles reading and writing to rsyncdb.toml.
        encryption/
            mod.rs: Manages encryption and decryption functionalities.
        db/
            mod.rs: Database connection and operations.
        cli/
            mod.rs: Command-line interface processing.
        action/
            mod.rs: Logic for building and performing actions.
        cron/
            mod.rs: Cron job scheduling and execution.

    Cargo.toml: Rust package manifest.

2. Dependencies

    toml: For parsing TOML files.
    dotenv: For loading .env files.
    sqlx: For database connections.
    mongodb: For MongoDB connections.
    crypto: For encryption and decryption.
    clap: For CLI argument parsing.
    cron: For cron job parsing and scheduling.
    daemonize: For running in the background.

3. Key Functionalities
3.1 Configuration Management

    Read and write to rsyncdb.toml.
    Load environment variables from .env, including encryption_key.

3.2 Database Connections

    Support connections to Microsoft SQL Express, SQL Developer Server, MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.
    Use sqlx for SQL databases and mongodb crate for MongoDB.

3.3 User Credentials Management

    --create-login: Prompt for DB credentials, save them in users_00?.toml encrypted with encryption_key.
    Read and decrypt users_00?.toml to get credentials.

3.4 Testing Database Connections

    --test-login --file: Test connection using credentials from users_00?.toml.
    --test-login with direct credentials: Test connection and print result.

3.5 Action Building

    --build-action: Interactive CLI to build an action (data transfer task) between databases.
    Save action details in actions_00?.toml, encrypted with encryption_key.

3.6 Performing Actions

    --perform-action: Read actions_00?.toml, perform the data transfer, log results.

3.7 Cron Job Scheduling

    --create-cron: Schedule actions based on cron syntax, save in crons.toml.
    --background-start: Run the application in the background, check crons.toml for scheduled tasks.

4. Implementation Notes

    Error Handling: Robust error handling and logging for each operation.
    Security: Ensure secure handling of credentials and encryption keys.
    Concurrency: Handle concurrent actions and cron jobs efficiently.
    Logging: Detailed logging for actions, especially for cron jobs and background operations.
    Testing: Write unit and integration tests for each module.

5. Future Enhancements

    Web interface for easier management.
    Support for additional database types.
    Advanced scheduling options for cron jobs.
    Real-time monitoring and alerts.

This design provides a blueprint for the rsyncdb application. Implementing this in Rust will require a deep understanding of Rust's async programming, database interaction, encryption, and CLI design principles.
